Tor zur Ostsee
==============
Tor zur Ostsee (Gate to Baltic Sea) is a joint project of [ITM](http://www.itm.uni-luebeck.de/ "Homepage Institute of Telematics") and [TraDaV](http://www.tradav.de/ "Homepage TraDaV") which is realized in the context of Lübeck's election to the German [City of Science 2012](http://www.hanse-trifft-humboldt.de/ "Homepage City of Science 2012").

Functionality
-------------
We created a small web application which displays the current status and position of ships around Lübeck.

It relies on [AIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System "WP article about AIS") data which is provided by the company [Vesseltracker](http://www.vesseltracker.com/ "Homepage Vesseltracker").


Origin
-------

Our web application is strongly inspired by [MarineTraffic.com](http://marinetraffic.com/ais/de/default.aspx "Homepage MarineTraffic") which is a project aiming to provide a world wide live ship map based on AIS data.

Usage
------
Due to the contract with our provider of AIS data we may not publicise the actual data. A complete installation of the system will be shown in Lübeck in 2012.

We aim to also include free AIS data sources in the application. Stay tuned ;-)
